Campground Reserve
==================
This is a little collection of scripts to run a PhantomJS browser as a script and try to reserve
a campsite on the NPS recreation.gov site.  Sick of trying to fight legions of people with nothing
better to do with their time than to sit clicking refresh, I decided to just automate the process
for myself.

Running
-------
Right now the script runs for Yosemite only.  To start it running though, just invoke the script

    bin/run
